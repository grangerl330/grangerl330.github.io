Growing up as a competitive tennis player, I used to hear this saying every day from my coach. He always tried to remind me that no matter where you are with your ability, you can always improve with the right mindset. To me, this saying means that you should always be ok with failures when working toward your goal, as long as you learn from those failures and improve.  Today, I am trying to adopt this philosophy to a brand new endeavor, learning to code.

My whole life my main focus has always been tennis. Playing competitive tournaments as a kid, playing on my college team, and coaching after I graduated.  About a month ago, I decided I was ready for something new. 

I did not have any experience with coding before looking in to Flatiron school, but I have always enjoyed logical problem solving. When I learned from a friend that coding is essentially this, I was intrigued. I completed most of the free online course offered by Flatiron School and was hooked right away.

Now I am once again a beginner, in this completely new field, and I am going in with the same mindset that I had when learning to play tennis. Every day I will be motivated and excited to learn something new.

After completing 4 months Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Bootcamp, I am finding myself thinking differently about things. 

When trying to complete a coding challenge, you have to think about the logical progression of every step of the necessary process. As I learn more about coding and go through the process of solving additional Flatiron labs, I notice how many things we see and use in our every day life, most that we probably take for granted, that are only able to function due to some kind of code beneath the surface.  

The obvious examples are things like smart phones or computers and all of the apps and websites that can be accessed on them. But sometimes I forget that even things that seem simpler on the surface, like a traffic light or my refridgerator, all require software to function in the advanced way we use them. And now that I know a bit about the process of writing code, every time I see an object that is running with software I think about the logic that would need to be written to make that object function and I realize how difficult it would be for me as a relative beginner to re-create it. 

This makes me extremely grateful for the fact that there have been so many intelligent people in the past and today that have been able to create these things that we all use on a daily basis. Hopefully one day I will be able to contribute my coding knowledge to something that can provie a benefit like this to society.
